# Real-Time Face Mask Detection using Deep Learning and OpenCV

## Project Overview
This project utilizes deep learning with a pretrained ResNet50 model to detect faces in real-time webcam footage and determine whether masks are present. The implementation employs OpenCV for face detection and classification, ensuring efficient real-time performance.

## Files in the Repository
- `MaskOrNot.py`: Main Python script for real-time mask detection.
- `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`: Haar Cascade file for face detection.
- `maskDetection.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook demonstrating the setup and execution process.

## Technology Stack
- **Python**: Main programming language used.
- **OpenCV**: Utilized for image processing and face detection.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For loading the ResNet50 model and performing image classification.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install opencv-python tensorflow`.
3. Run the script: `python MaskOrNot.py` for real-time detection through your webcam.
4. Alternatively, you can explore the Jupyter notebook `maskDetection.ipynb` for a step-by-step tutorial.
